STARS is a general data fusion methodology utilizing spatiotemporal statistical models to optimally combine high spatial resolution VSWIR measurements with high temporal resolution measurements from multiple instruments. The methods are highly-scalable, able to fuse <100 m spatial resolution products in near-real time (<24 hrs) on regional to global scales, to facilitate online data processing as well as large-scale reprocessing of mission datasets. The statistical spatiotemporal modeling framework provides with each fused surface reflectance product associated pixel-level uncertainties incorporating any known data source measurement uncertainties, bias characteristics, and degree of historical data missingness. 

The specific capabilities offered by STARS are: 
1. automatic, high-resolution spatial and temporal gap-filling, 
2. a tunable fusion framework allowing the user to choose a level of accuracy vs computational complexity, and 
3. quantifiable uncertainties that can be used for downstream product sensitivity/uncertainty assessments and that can be incorporated into higher-order data product quality flags.
